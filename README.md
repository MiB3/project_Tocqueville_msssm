## General Introduction
According to the historian Alexis de Tocqueville, before the French Revolution, economic and social conditions improved significantly. As a result, paradoxically, the French became more frustrated. Consequently, the Revolution broke out. Due to this observation, the phenomenon that in a social system aggregate frustration can diffuse when conditions improve is called "Tocqueville's paradox" (Neckel 2010). 

Tocqueville's paradox has been reporter in several empirical studies (e.g. Stouffer et al. 1965, Peirò et al. 2010) and it is important to know under which circumstance improving conditions fuel frustration rather than satisfaction. Usually it is costly for a social entity - be it an organization or a society - to provide further chances, let's say, for upward mobility. When improvements lead to less satisfaction, obviously, resources have been waisted (Raub 1984).

Although many explanations of Tocqueville's paradox have been proposed (Merton and Rossy 1957, Runciman 1966: 19–20), the game theoretic model by the French sociologist Raymond Boudon (1979) provides the most elaborated one (Raub 1984). Nevertheless, the model is based on restrictive assumptions and it seems worthwhile to relax some of them in order to make the model more realistic.

## The Model
In a social system, each of N players decides whether or not to invest resources C in a competition for a scarce and highly valued good, e.g. a high prestige position within a firm. Should there be more investors than positions, some competitors will invest in vain. Given the good is valuable enough, a small increase in the chances of obtaining this good (e.g. one additional high prestige positions in a firm) can tempt a disproportionate number of players to invest. As a result, there are more additional frustrated losers than additional satisfied winners and on the aggregate level, dissatisfaction increases.

The parameters of the models are the number of players N, the number of scarce positions k, and the payoffs for successful investors a, frustrated losers c and non-investors b. It must hold that a > b > c and that 0 < k < N. Under certain parameter constellations, the model predicts an inversely u-shaped trajectory of the rate of frustrated losers (Boudon 1979, Berger & Diekmann 2013). When conditions slightly improve, the number of frustrated losers increases: Tocqueville paradox emerges as a consequence of interdependent individual investment decisions. When chances are further enhanced, more and more investors succeed and, consequently, aggregate frustration decreases again.


## Fundamental Questions
Tocqueville's paradox is derived from restrictive model assumptions such as homogeneous and totally rational actors. Should the model not just provide an idealized mechanism of how Tocqueville's paradox is brought about, but also a realistic explanation, it must be demonstrated that the model generates the paradox under less restrictive assumptions. For instance, in the real world, actors differ in their risk-preferences or their endowment of resources. Moreover, they are not perfectly informed about the chances of succeeding in a competition and their beliefs about this might be formed by information obtained through networks. Hence, the model might be extended by one ore more of these factors (heterogeneous actors, resources, belief-formation through networks). In doing so, one could describe the effect of one of these variables on the occurrence of Tocqueville's paradox.

## Expected Results
Varying individual properties will lead to an increase in the variation of possible model outcomes. For instance, if some actors have more pessimistic beliefs about chances of willing or have to take higher costs for investing, they will invest with a lower probability. Consequently, the number of losers will not increase as dramatically as under standard assumptions. Thus, the conditions under which the model generates Tocqueville's paradox will be less general. This implies however, that besides a more realistic explanation, more precise predictions about the occurrence of the target phenomenon can be made.

## Other
In principle, no data is necessary for this project since it is a purely theoretical simulation. Nevertheless, empirically measured risk preferences could be used as an alternative to the standard assumption of risk neutral preferences.
